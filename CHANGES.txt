== CHANGELOG ==

=== 1.9.0 (by iionly) ===

- Updated to work on Elgg 1.9 - 1.11 (requires Elgg 1.9 at minimum),
- Use of colorbox instead of fancybox for event details popup on edit event poll page,
- Adjustments for UI to work also with Aalborg theme,
- Sending of on-site messages instead of on-site notifications (new on-site notifications of Elgg 1.9 won't allow any message texts but only "subject" lines which seem not enough in this case in my opinion),
- Fix of deprecation issues.

=== 1.8.0 (by iionly) ===

- Made to work on Elgg 1.8 (requires Elgg 1.8 at minimum),
- Cleanup of code,
- Revised UI (add/edit event poll view, event polls list view, event poll vote view, menu entries),
- Editing of event polls not yet implemented but fixed code to correctly fully reset an event poll when editing the event,
- German translations added.
